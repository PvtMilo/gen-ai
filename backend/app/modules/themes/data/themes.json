Outfit transformation: cyberpunk techwear for each person (futuristic jackets, tactical streetwear, subtle armor panels, neon accent trims), no logos, no brand marks, no readable text. Background: rainy neon cyberpunk city street at night with holographic billboards and glowing signage, wet asphalt reflections, cinematic lighting, ultra-realistic photography, high-end photobooth look.",
