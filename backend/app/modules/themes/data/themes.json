    "prompt": "Photorealistic HIGH-END transformation into a BRIGHT, vibrant futuristic neon city (not dark). Works for SOLO or GROUP photos. STRICT RULES (per person): do NOT change face identity, do NOT change facial features, do NOT change expression, do NOT change pose, do NOT change body proportions, do NOT change camera angle or framing. Preserve hair/headwear exactly as in the original (if hijab/headscarf exists, keep it; if hair is visible, keep the hairstyle). CHANGE ONLY: outfit and environment. Outfit: premium futuristic techwear/cyberpunk clothing tailored to each person's existing silhouette and modesty level, with hyper-real fabric detail (weave, stitching, seams, zippers), believable thickness/weight, and natural folds. Background: clean futuristic city with colorful neon signage, bright ambient glow, reflective surfaces, subtle mist, soft bokeh lights, depth-of-field. QUALITY PRIORITY: ultra-detailed faces and eyes without altering identity, crisp skin texture (pores), accurate edge detail around hair/hijab, realistic micro-contrast, natural sharpening (no oversharpen), high dynamic range, 8k-quality detail, editorial commercial lighting: flattering bright key light on all subjects, balanced exposure, consistent shadows across the group, gentle neon rim light, correct perspective/scale, realistic reflections, seamless blending (no cutout look), vibrant but natural color grading.",
